Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project (ATU) - Higher Diploma in Data Analytics

## Task:
• The project is to create a notebook investigating the variables and data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated with Ronald A Fisher

• In the notebook, you should discuss the classification of each variable within the data set according to common variable types and scales of measurement in mathematics, statistics, and Python.

• Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate summary statistics to describe each variable.

• Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate plot(s) for each variable.

• The notebook should follow a cohesive narrative about the data set

### Note:
project.ipynb contains the project work.

My tasks.ipynb file is contained in a separate GitHub repository - [found here](https://github.com/turps-pc90/fund_data/). I inadvertently set up a separate repository for the task and project and rather than losing my commits from merging, I am referring to this repository in the README file of the fund_data repository.

### Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:

Python
Jupyter Notebook

I have saved a requirements.txt file and this can be installed (if necessary) by running:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

<hr>

### Installation
``` git clone https://github.com/turps-pc90/foda-project.git ```

<hr>

### Usage
The Jupyter Notebook can be ran within an IDE (I have used VS Code) but it can also be launched from your terminal by running the below:

``` jupyter notebook ```
