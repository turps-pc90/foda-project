    "#### Classification of Each Variable\n",
    "There are five variables within Fisher's Iris dataset. These are: \n",
    "\n",
    "> - Sepal Length (*sepal_length*)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Sepal Width (*sepal_width*)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Petal Length (*petal_length*)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Petal Width (*petal_width*)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Species (*species*)\n",
    ">\n",
    "##### Classification\n",
    "[Laerd Statistics](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/types-of-variable.php) have a useful guide for classification of data where they split data into two basic variables - *categorical* and *continuous*. Unless otherwise stated, quotes in the definitions below are from the Laerd Statistics definitions as per the link. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorical (Qualitative):**\n",
    "> *Nominal Variables* \n",
    "> - \"Variables that have two or more categories, but which do not have an intrinsic order\" (Laerd Statistics). McKenna et al (2023) describes nominal data as data classified \"purely by labelling or naming values\". An example for nominal variables could be where a car dealer classifies their cars into distinct categories - *hatchback*, *saloon*, *estate* and *SUV*. The only variable from the dataset that would be a nominal is *species*. When Edgar Anderson collected the data for this dataset, he selected which species of iris to measure and could have picked other species but decided upon three with no order on any of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "> *Dichotomous Variables*\n",
    "> - Nominal variables which have only two categories or levels. Classifying of gender (as male or female), GAA season-ticket holders (as yes or no), Lyon's or Barry's teabags (as Lyon's or Barry's) are examples of dichotomous variables. There are no dichotomous variables in the iris dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Ordinal Variables*\n",
    "> - Like nomrinal variables but the categories could be ranked, even if the distances between categories are not specific. An example of ordinal variables could be education level. The gap between *primary school* and *secondary school*, compared to *secondary school* and *university* are not uniform but one would rank education level as *primary school* at the lowest of the variables for education level. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous (Quantative):**\n",
    "> *Interval Variables* \n",
    "> - \"Variables for which their central characteristic is that they can be measured along a continuum and they have a numerical value (for example, temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit)\". The *sepal length*, *sepal width*, *petal length* and *petal width* variables do not fit the definition of interval variables as while they measured along a continuum, a zero measurement of any of the four measurements would indicate an absence of that measurement. This would leave the four variables as being the only other type of continuous (qualitative) variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "> *Ratio Variables*\n",
    "> - \"Are interval variables, but with the added condition that 0 (zero) of the measurement indicates that there is none of that variable\". The *sepal length*, *sepal width*, *petal length* and *petal width* variables are all examples of a ratio variable. \n"
